Digital Representative Server is an idea of a protocol bundle, that would simplify architecture of most of the websites and online systems.

Core proposal is a server that would represent an individual or a company in the digital world and interact with online system for them. It can be though as an email server, only that it could provide services such as:
- authentication
- communication (email, real-time messaging)
- payment gateway
- service/product browsing and ordering

The whole concept is currently under development.
